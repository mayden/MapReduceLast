#Collocations
A collocation is a sequence of words or terms that co-occur more often than would be expected by chance. The identification of collocations - such as 'crystal clear', 'cosmetic surgery', 'איכות סביבה' - is essential for many natural language processing and information extraction application.
In this assignment, we will use Normalized Pointwise Mutual Information (NPMI), in order to decide whether a given pair of ordered words is a collocation, where two ordered words with a high NPMI value are expected to be a collocation.

#Job Flow
A Job Flow is a collection of processing steps that Amazon Elastic MapReduce runs on a specified dataset using a set of Amazon EC2 instances. A Job Flow consists of one or more steps, each of which must complete in sequence successfully, for the Job Flow to finish.

#Job Flow Step
A Job Flow Step is a user-defined unit of processing, mapping roughly to one algorithm that manipulates the data. A step is a Hadoop MapReduce application implemented as a Java jar or a streaming program written in Java, Ruby, Perl, Python, PHP, R, or C++. For example, to count the frequency with which words appear in a document, and output them sorted by the count, the first step would be a MapReduce application which counts the occurrences of each word, and the second step would be a MapReduce application which sorts the output from the first step based on the calculated frequenciess.
